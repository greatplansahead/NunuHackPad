# MyHackPad

I tired making a macropad. it was my first time making a PCB, desgining a case and writing firmware! The pcb looks nice and the case works however, i had some trouble with the firmware. the kmk hopefully works but qmk could not pass the lint check.


it is a 3x3 macro pad with an encoder and 4 neopixels
here are some pictures!
